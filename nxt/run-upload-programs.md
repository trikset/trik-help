There are several options for running programs for the LEGO NXT controller:

* Step-by-step interpretation of the diagram with a simulation of the robot's behavior on a 2D model.
* Step-by-step interpretation of the diagram with sending commands to the robot via Bluetooth or USB.
* Download the program to the robot and then execute it autonomously without communication with a computer.

## **Interpretation with a simulation of robot behavior**

{% hint style="info" %}
.In 2D robot model mode, commands are not sent to the robot but are executed step by step for the virtual model displayed on the screen. See the article "[2D Model](../studio/2d-model/)" for details.

&#x20;1\. Turn on the two-dimensional model mode.
