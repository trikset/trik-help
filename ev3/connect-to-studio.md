The LEGO EV3 controller can be connected to the TRIK Studio using:

1. [USB](connect-to-studio.md#usb).
2. [Bluetooth](connect-to-studio.md#bluetooth).

In each of the two options, you must first select the LEGO EV3 platform in the TRIK Studio settings under "[Robots](../studio/settings.md#robots)".

## USB connection

1. Connect the USB cable to the LEGO EV3 controller and to the computer with TRIK Studio.
2. Turn on the LEGO EV3 controller.

After that, you can load programs on the robot. No additional steps or drivers are required.

## Bluetooth connection

The procedure to connect the LEGO EV3 robot via Bluetooth is the [same as the LEGO NXT robot](../nxt/connect-to-studio.md).
