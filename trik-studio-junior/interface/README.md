# TRIK Studio Junior interface

The TRIK Studio interface depends on the selected mode. TRIK Studio Junior, like [TRIK Studio](../../studio/interface/), has two modes:

1. ****[**Editing mode**](../../studio/interface/#mode-edit)\
   It is intended for creating a robot control diagram and executing it in the generation mode.\

2. ****[**Debug mode**](../../studio/interface/#mode-debug)\
   It is intended for executing and debugging a program on a 2D model.

The TRIK Studio Junior interface depends on the selected mode and coincides with the TRIK Studio interface:

{% content-ref url="../../studio/interface/" %}
[interface](../../studio/interface/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
