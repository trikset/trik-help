# Exercises in TRIK Studio Junior

Exercise is a regular program in which you cannot modify some parts of a solution (blocks, sensors setup, world parameters). That is, any diagram can be saved as an exercise for students.

Exercises are created and loaded in TRIK Studio Junior in the same way as in TRIK Studio:

{% content-ref url="../studio/exercises.md" %}
[exercises.md](../studio/exercises.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
