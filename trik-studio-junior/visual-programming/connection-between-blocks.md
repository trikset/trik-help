Links between blocks in TRIK Studio indicate the control flow of interpretation between blocks.

#### Example

Let it be necessary that after the delay the program ends immediately.\
\
To do this, connect the [Timer](blocks.md#timer) and [Final](blocks.md#final-node) blocks with a link pointing from the "Timer" block to the program end block.

Creating and deleting links in TRIK Studio Junior is the same as in TRIK Studio:

{% content-ref url="../../studio/programming-visual/connection-between-blocks.md" %}
[connection-between-blocks.md](../../studio/programming-visual/connection-between-blocks.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
