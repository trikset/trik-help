The TRIK Gamepad is a remote control for controlling programmable TRIK educational robots, available as [apps](app.md) for Android and iOS and as a [utility](utility.md) in TRIK Studio.

To control the robot with the remote control you need to write a [program](../remote-control.md) and run it on the robot.
