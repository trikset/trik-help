# Connecting to the TRIK controller via Wi-Fi

The TRIK controller has a Wi-Fi module that can work in two modes:

1. The **access point** mode, when the controller creates a new network, and we connect devices to it.
2. The **Wi-Fi client** mode, when we connect the controller to an existing network.

To select a mode in the controller menu, select the `Network` item.

Read about connecting the controller to devices in different modes and the interaction of several controllers in the articles:

[network-connection.md](network-connection.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="connect-to-ts.md" %}
[connect-to-ts.md](connect-to-ts.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="interaction/" %}
[interaction](interaction/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
