The TRIK controller is supplied with power:

1\. Power supply with 12V output voltage and 2A output current or 12V 5A power supply (depending on the set).

2\. Three-cell lithium polymer battery (LiPo) with a voltage of 12.6 V and a capacity of 2200 mAh or 4200 mAh.

The battery used has two connectors:

1\. Specific two-pin with power wires to connect to the controller.

2\. Four-pin for connection to a dedicated battery charger with balancer.

## LiPo battery operating conditions and safety precautions

1. Only use dedicated battery chargers to charge the batteries.
2. Observe the condition of the battery while it is being charged. If the cells appear to be blistering, immediately disconnect the battery from the charger and move it to a fireproof cover. Do not resume the charging process of a faulty battery.
3. Short-circuiting causes a rapid discharge, with currents in excess of those permitted, which can cause battery failure, fire, and severe burns. Do not short-circuit batteries or cells.
4. Do not store batteries in direct sunlight.
5. Do not allow the voltage to drop below 3.2 V per battery cell. Deep discharge causes permanent damage to the battery and poses a risk of fire.
6. When storing the battery for a long time (more than a week), the voltage per battery cell must be in the range of 3.7-3.87 V. Failure to observe this condition will significantly reduce battery life.
7. Do not expose the battery to heat, including self-heating above 45°C. If the battery is hotter than 45°C, allow it to cool to room temperature before use or charging.
8. Protect the battery from mechanical damage. If a shock occurs, carefully inspect the battery on a refractory surface. Continue to use the battery only when you are absolutely certain that there is no damage.

## Battery Charge

{% hint style="danger" %}
If the balancer is missing or not used, if the charge voltage or current is exceeded, or if any of the battery cells are overcharged, the battery may not only fail but also self-ignite.
{% endhint %}

1.  To charge LiPo batteries, only use a dedicated microprocessor-based battery charger with a complex charge cycle and built-in balancer.

2. Carefully inspect the battery before you begin charging it.
3. Charge batteries on a fireproof surface.
4. Allow the battery to cool to ambient temperature before beginning the charging process.
5. It is recommended to monitor the temperature of the battery during charging. A temperature over 40-50°C indicates that something is wrong or the battery is ruined. Disconnect the battery from the charger immediately.

## Recycle

### 1 way

Dispose of lithium polymer batteries at a specialized company in your community.

### 2 way

Lithium polymer batteries are environmentally friendly. For safety reasons, however, lithium polymer batteries should be fully discharged before disposal.

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the battery is physically damaged (inflated, split, etc.) it should not be discharged. Go directly to point 5 below.
{% endhint %}

1. Make sure that the battery is not hot (above ambient temperature).
2. Place the battery in a fireproof container or bucket of sand.
3. Connect the battery to the battery arrester. Set the discharge voltage to the lowest possible value.
4. Discharge the battery until its voltage reaches 1 V or lower.
5. Prepare a plastic container (do not use metal) with cold water and mix 1/2 cup salt per liter of water. Leave the battery in the saltwater container for at least 2 weeks.
6. Take the battery out of the saltwater and wrap it in newspaper or paper towels.
7. Dispose of regular garbage.
