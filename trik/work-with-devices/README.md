The TRIK controller allows you to build a robotic model without limiting yourself in the choice of "equipment" for it.

It allows you to connect digital and analog sensors, external devices via i2c and UART protocols, has two video ports and a USB connector.

There are 6 ports for servo motors and 4 ports for power motors.

This section contains information on how to connect sensors, motors, cameras to the TRIK controller - it describes the process of testing the connected devices, their configuration, and effective use together with the TRIK Studio programming environment.
