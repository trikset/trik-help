There are several options for executing programs for the TRIK controller:

* Step-by-step diagram interpretation with a simulation of robot behavior on a 2D model.
* Uploading the program to the robot and its further autonomous execution without communication with the computer.

## Interpretation with a simulation of robot behavior <a href="#2d" id="2d"></a>

{% hint style="info" %}
In the robot's 2D model mode, commands are not transmitted to the robot but are executed step-by-step by the virtual robot displayed on the screen. For more information, see the article ["2D Model"](../studio/2d-model/).
{% endhint %}

1\. Turn on 2D model mode.

## Uploading to the controller <a href="#upload" id="upload"></a>

From TRIK Studio, you can upload a  program to a robot in order to execute it autonomously later without connection to a computer.\
1\. [Connect](wi-fi/) the TRIK controller to TRIK Studio.\
2\. Click on the "Upload Program" button.
