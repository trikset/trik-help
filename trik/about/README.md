The TRIK controller has a color touchscreen display, [programmable buttons](../programming-visual/sensory-variables.md) and a Wi-Fi module that can operate in [two modes](../wi-fi/).

The TRIK controller is compatible with a wide range of [peripheral devices](../work-with-devices/), including all the necessary equipment for controlling DC motors and servo drives, as well as for receiving and processing information from digital and analog sensors, microphones, and video modules.

The TRIK controller supports various ways of connecting via [Wi-Fi](../wi-fi/), [connecting and working with external devices](../work-with-devices/).
