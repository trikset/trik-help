# Adding and removing blocks

## Add blocks to the scene

You can add blocks to the [scene](../interface/#editor-window) in TRIK Studio in three ways:&#x20;

1. [Drag and drop](blocks-add-delete.md#dropanddown) the corresponding icons from the palette of elements onto the diagram.
2. [Using mouse gesture](blocks-add-delete.md#mouse-gesture).
3. [When creating a new connection ](blocks-add-delete.md#connection)between blocks using a linker.

### Drag and drop from the palette <a href="#dropanddown" id="dropanddown"></a>

Left-click on the necessary block located in the [Palette](../interface/#panel-palette) panel. Without releasing the mouse button, move the block onto the scene.

### Use mouse gestures <a href="#mouse-gesture" id="mouse-gesture"></a>

Draw on the scene a special image of the block with the **Right** mouse button. The block appears in the center of the drawn image.&#x20;

Gestures can be drawn with a few strokes. The gesture input ends if the strokes have not been drawn for some time (you can set the time in the settings window on the [Behavior](../settings.md#behavior) tab).

Available conditional images can be found in two ways:

1\. In the "Mouse Gestures" window, which opens through the main menu`Tools → Mouse gestures`.

2\. In the tooltip that appears when you hover over a block in the Palette panel.

### Add block when creating a new connection <a href="#connection" id="connection"></a>

1. Start [creating a connection using the linker](connection-between-blocks.md#linker) (a colored circle to the right of the block that appears after the block is selected) and release the left mouse button when the cursor is on an empty section of the diagram.
2. In the menu that appears, select "Create new element". A new menu with blocks will appear.
3. Select the block you need.
