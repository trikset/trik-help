# Visual programming

A program in the TRIK Studio is represented as a sequence of the [blocks](blocks.md) connected by the [links](connection-between-blocks.md).&#x20;

Each program corresponds to the [main diagram](./#main-diagram), which may contain other [diagrams (subprograms)](./#subprograms). Diagrams are packaged in projects stored on the disk.

## Main diagram <a href="#main-diagram" id="main-diagram"></a>

The main diagram is created when the [project is created](../start.md#new-project). About adding and removing blocks to the [scene](../interface/#editor-window), read the article: &#x20;

{% content-ref url="blocks-add-delete.md" %}
[blocks-add-delete.md](blocks-add-delete.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

## Subprograms

The diagrams with subprograms are created automatically when you add the block "[Subprogram](blocks.md#subprogram)" to the scene. In this case, the subprogram is displayed by double-clicking on the "Subprogram" block on the scene.
